# Utility Scripts

These are general scripts to help assist with GitHub. It's to assist on rebasing, pulling and calling for a pull request. I use this since I'm a lazy person.

You can add this on with build-like scripts and setup scripts so that it feels more complete. At the moment, it's at its barebones, since it's really only being used as a git-cli option.

Anyway, feel free to use it.
